## Hi, my name is Jiajin Li.
### I go, I watch, I listen and I report back for you.

**An information architect by education, a market researcher by profession and a podcaster by accident.**

I was born and raised in a coastal city called Ningbo and I went to Ireland for university.
I'm a slashie. A strategic marketing student at Imperial Business School. A part-time scholar at Watson Institute's Accelerator. A podcast producer at Imperial Tech, Media & Telecoms Club.

I have cross-industry project experience in FMCG, EdTech and short videos/live streaming. I'm always curious about exploring the “Go Global” strategy and overseas brand promotion. I've enjoyed working in cross-functional and outcome-driven environments at Google, Alibaba and TikTok. My previous working experience has allowed her to be proficient in new digital marketing skills such as social listening, search engine optimisation, and competitive monitoring. 

I’m keen on working in the sweet spot between strategy and delivery and to get closer to the “how”. My enthusiasm for story-telling and business analysis is something I hope to bring to the company. It’s always "passion o’clock" in case-based analysis and business game-theory scenarios for deconstructing client problems and identifying and innovating solutions.

**Highlights:**
- **Received full scholarship from Watson Institute's Accelerator 2022**
- **Finalist at Alibaba GDT Global Challenge 2021**
- **Being awarded second prize at Young Sustainable Impact personal project 2020**
- **Being awarded first prize at Dublin Techstars Student Startup Weekend 2020**
